A
* think of another way to simulate the number of stop codons in motifs, or
  redo/find the script that calculated dinucleotide frequencis from the
  coding exons

B
* do the ND test for codon sets, but instead use the real dataset
  - predict hits to the set of motifs
  - for each codon set, calculate density
  - repeat, but instead randomise the location of the ESEs?
* repeat above but also consider only for sets with the same purine content

C
[*] repeat stop depletion in lincRNA sequences (hangueuer) without grouping the family results
[*] repeat the stop depletion using the cabili sequences
* repeat the analysis in single exon cases for both hangueuer and cabili
[*] repeat removing everything that has been called ese

D
[*] do with ND, then report Z score results
[*] repeat with cabili

E
* do with another set of ESEs?

F

I
[*] do a substiution analysis, comparing sites in stops and non stops as in Schuler - working10
[*] clean up this script, run for protein coding genes properly

[*] try to do a substitution analysis on lincRNA
  - upload bed to galaxy server
  - stitch gene blocks
  - return sequences, only keep those that match the lengths of the ones
    I have extracted and then filter to remove those withi indels > 15%
    of the sequence
* also do the substitution rate thing in introns to compare with ds scores
